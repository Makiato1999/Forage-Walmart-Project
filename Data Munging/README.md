#### Your task is to insert all of the data contained in the provided spreadsheets into the SQLite database. You will write a Python script which:
- Reads each row from the spreadsheets.
- Extracts the relevant data.
- Munges it into a format that fits the database schema.
- Inserts the data into the database.
#### All task4 resources(csv and database) are from [task4_repository](https://github.com/theforage/forage-walmart-task-4), I forked this repository and pushed my codes [here](https://github.com/Makiato1999/forage-walmart-task-4).
